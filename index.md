I am a PhD student at the Computer Architecture Group (gaZ) at the University of 
Zaragoza under the supervision of Pablo Ibañez and Jesús Alastruey. 
Before that I took my BSc and M.Eng at the University of Zaragoza (2012-2018).

My research interests focus on Computer Architecture, specifically on the memory
hierarchy.

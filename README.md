# MarkWeb (Web with Markdown)

This is an example of how I made my webpage using Markdown and Pandoc (and
sometimes a bit of HTML).

## Requirements

* pandoc
* wget
* git

## How does it work?

You just write your webpage in Markdown (and add some of HTML if you want extra
features) and run the _gen.sh_ scripts which generate HTML to upload to your
server.

Maybe you need to change the script _gen.sh_, don't worry is short and simple.

## Other stuff

This repository has the code of my webpage as example. I use 
[air](https://github.com/agusnt/air) and [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

Please reference this repository if you use my code (self-advertising!!!)

## Future work

* Can I do it responsive?
* Automatic upload to the server? (It's only add SCP to the script... but I'm
  lazy)
